## **AIM**

To study and implement basic **Python list operations** using built-in functions and methods, specifically to

1. find the maximum element in a list using `max()` and
2. add a new element to a list using the `append()` method.

---

## **THEORY**

A **list** in Python is a mutable, ordered data structure that allows storage of multiple elements of different data types under a single variable name. Lists are widely used due to their flexibility and availability of built-in functions and methods that simplify data manipulation.

* The `max()` function is a built-in Python function that returns the largest element present in a list. It works by internally comparing all elements of the list and identifying the highest value.
* The `append()` method is used to add a single new element at the end of an existing list. This method modifies the original list without creating a new one.

These operations improve program efficiency and reduce the need for complex logic when handling collections of data.

## Program 1: Check whether a number is Positive, Negative or Zero

### Algorithm

1. Start
2. Read a number from the user
3. If the number is greater than 0, print "Positive"
4. Else if the number is less than 0, print "Negative"
5. Else, print "Zero"
6. Stop

---

## Program 2: Check whether a number is Even or Odd

### Algorithm

1. Start
2. Read a number from the user
3. If the number modulo 2 is equal to 0, print "Even"
4. Else, print "Odd"
5. Stop

---

## Program 3: Find the Largest of Three Numbers

### Algorithm

1. Start
2. Read three numbers from the user
3. If the first number is greater than or equal to the other two, print the first number
4. Else if the second number is greater than or equal to the other two, print the second number
5. Else, print the third number
6. Stop

## Program 4: Grading of a Subject Based on Marks

### Algorithm

1. Start
2. Read marks from the user
3. If marks are greater than 100, print "Invalid Marks"
4. Else if marks are 90 or above, print Grade A
5. Else if marks are 75 or above, print Grade B
6. Else if marks are 60 or above, print Grade C
7. Else if marks are 40 or above, print Grade D
8. Else, print "Fail"
9. Stop

## Program 5: Check whether a Year is a Leap Year

### Algorithm

1. Start
2. Read year from the user
3. If the year is divisible by 400 or divisible by 4 but not by 100, print "Leap Year"
4. Else, print "Not a Leap Year"
5. Stop

---

## Program 6: Increment of a Given Date

### Algorithm

1. Start
2. Read date in DD-MM-YYYY format
3. Separate day, month, and year
4. Check whether the year is a leap year
5. Assign number of days to the given month
6. Increment the day by one
7. If day exceeds month limit, set day to 1 and increment month
8. If month exceeds 12, set month to 1 and increment year
9. Display the next date
10. Stop

---

## Program 7: Check whether a Letter is Vowel or Consonant

### Algorithm

1. Start
2. Read a character from the user
3. If the character is a vowel, print "Vowel"
4. Else, print "Consonant"
5. Stop

---

## Program 8: Calculate Gross Salary of an Employee

### Algorithm

1. Start
2. Read basic salary
3. If basic salary is less than or equal to 10,000, calculate HRA and DA at given rates
4. Else if basic salary is less than or equal to 20,000, calculate HRA and DA at given rates
5. Else, calculate HRA and DA at higher rates
6. Add basic salary, HRA, and DA to get gross salary
7. Display gross salary
8. Stop

---

## Program 9: Calculate Income Tax Based on Annual Income

### Algorithm

1. Start
2. Read annual income
3. If income is within tax-free limit, set tax to zero
4. Else calculate tax according to income slabs
5. Display income tax
6. Stop

---

## **CONCLUSION**

Thus, the experiment successfully demonstrated the use of Python list operations. The `max()` function was used to determine the largest element in a list, and the `append()` method was used to insert a new element into an existing list. This practical implementation helped in understanding how built-in functions and methods make data handling in Python simple and efficient.
